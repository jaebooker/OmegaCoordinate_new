## About

A decentralized dAPP run on a local Ethereum test blockchain network, using Solidity and Truffle on the backend, and React and Web3 on the frontend. View a list of projects, with the option to "Join" one that interests you.


## Installation

1. Install Truffle globally by running 'npm install -g truffle' in the terminal.
2. Run "truffle develop" in the terminal.
4. Run 'migrate --reset' in the developer console.
5. Add Metamask add-on to Chrome or use Brave with Metamask enabled.
6. Set Metamask to equal the local server running on truffle develop (it should have printed to terminal when you started running it)
7. In a terminal separate from the Truffle Developer one, run 'npm run start'
8. Page should load automatically. If not, it can be located at http://localhost:3000
9. Click "Sign Up" and fill in your name. Metamask should open a window requesting "gas". Click "submit" in the Metamask window. This should bring you to a welcome page, with a list of projects to join. If not, you can view them in "/projects" (if you are logged in).
10. You can run the tests by running "truffle test" in the normal terminal.
